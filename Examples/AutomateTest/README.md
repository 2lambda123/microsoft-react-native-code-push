The goal of this script is to automate the testing of react-native, react-native-code-push and their internal compatibility. Run **./run.sh** to create an app and test it. 

You can configure below variables in the bash. 

1. `code_push_version`
2. `react_native_code_push_version`
3. `react_native_version`
4. `mobile_env`

If you use other libs or packages, and fail to run this test, welcome to modify this script so that we can reproduce any issues that you have.

Have fun.
